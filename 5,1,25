Question 2)https://leetcode.com/problems/wiggle-sort-ii/submissions/1498785694

Approach
Steps
Find the Median:

Use a quickselect or sort to find the median of the array.
Three-Way Partitioning:

Rearrange the array such that:
Elements 
>
> median are in one part.
Elements 
=
= median are in another part.
Elements 
<
< median are in the last part.
This step groups elements effectively for wiggle placement.
Place Elements Using Virtual Index Mapping:

Assign elements from the smaller half to even indices.
Assign elements from the larger half to odd indices

Question 3)https://leetcode.com/problems/shopping-offers/submissions/1498797864

Algorithm
Input:
price: An array where price[i] is the price of the 𝑖𝑡ℎ item.
special: A list of special offers where each offer is an array. The first 𝑛 elements specify the number of items, and the last element is the total cost of the offer.
needs: An array specifying the required number of each item.
Output:
The minimum cost to satisfy the needs.
