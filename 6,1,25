Quesiton 2)https://leetcode.com/problems/longest-mountain-in-array/submissions/1499845273

NOTE-
>Algorithm
Initialize a variable maxLength = 0 to store the length of the longest mountain.
Traverse the array from index 1 to 
𝑛
−
2
n−2 (because a peak requires elements on both sides).
For each peak found:
Expand left until the sequence stops increasing.
Expand right until the sequence stops decreasing.
Update maxLength with the calculated mountain length.
Return maxLength.
